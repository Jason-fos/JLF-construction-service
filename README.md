For the colour scheme bright colours were chosen to catch the users eye and draw attention
to information and links on the page. Green and blue was chosen as they are visually pleasing positive on screen colours and the light grey in the header and footer is a neutral colour that goes well with the colours on the page.

Playfair+Display was used for the logo and headings as it looks good in a larger font size and is easy to read. 
<br>
Merriweather was used for the body text as it compliments the headings nicely and is highly readable on screen, both have back up font of sans-serif as its also easily readable on screen.
